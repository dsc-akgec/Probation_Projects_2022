# Music-recommendation-ML-model
GDSC final project
1) On first commit i created the basic archietecture of the working program but it recognise emotion through images with the help of pre-trained model.
2) On second commit i added a face recognition model but it's accuracy is low. so, im going foreward with a pre-trained model.
3) On third commit, I used OPENCV to read the image and do some manipulation according to our needs and detect emotions through a pre-trained model.
